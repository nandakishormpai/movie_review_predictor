#movie_review_predictor

Review analysis model

Python script 'Train.py' used to train the model is made through the source i got from https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-word-embedding-model-predicting-movie-review-sentiment/

I worked on the prediction script

First clone it and what you have to do is paste your review in the text file my_review inside the file my_prediction 

You should install tensorflow version 1.5.0 or above if you have not.

Run predict.py

I hope you get your result..thanks for using
